Greetings, and welcome.

Here I store my coding projects that had been done during my studies at the Moscow State University (01.09.2018-24.02.2022) and later on. My public repositories are meant to be a showcase of my skills, so please feel free to read, download and use whatever you want for ethical purposes.
